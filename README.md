# Audiobook
A Python based Audiobook.
In this project, we implemented a simple PDF to audio converter. This project will be able to scans page(s) of PDF and read it using audio, to the user. While this project is good for simple text reading, it does not perform well if a scientific paper with equations is given to it because equations are not supported to be read in pytesseract OCR library which we used to convert image to text.
